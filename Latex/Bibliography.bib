abstract = {Recent large scale experiments have shown that the normalized information distance, an algorithmic information measure, is among the best similarity metrics for melody classification. This paper proposes the use of this distance as a fitness function which may be used by genetic algorithms to automatically generate music in a given pre-defined style. The minimization of this distance of the generated music to a set of musical guides makes it possible to obtain computer-generated music which recalls the style of a certain human author. The recombination operator plays an important role in this problem and thus several variations are tested to fine tune the genetic algorithm for this application. The superiority of the relative pitch envelope over other music parameters, such as the lengths of the notes, brought us to develop a simplified algorithm that nevertheless obtains interesting results.},

abstract = {While Kolmogorov (1965) complexity is the accepted absolute measure of information content in an individual finite object, a similarly absolute notion is needed for the information distance between two individual objects, for example, two pictures. We give several natural definitions of a universal information metric, based on length of shortest programs for either ordinary computations or reversible (dissipationless) computations. It turns out that these definitions are equivalent up to an additive logarithmic term. We show that the information distance is a universal cognitive similarity distance. We investigate the maximal correlation of the shortest programs involved, the maximal uncorrelation of programs (a generalization of the Slepian-Wolf theorem of classical information theory), and the density properties of the discrete metric spaces induced by the information distances. A related distance measures the amount of nonreversibility of a computation. Using the physical theory of reversible computation, we give an appropriate (universal, antisymmetric, and transitive) measure of the thermodynamic work required to transform one object in another object by the most efficient process. Information distance between individual objects is needed in pattern recognition where one wants to express effective notions of "pattern similarity" or "cognitive similarity" between individual objects and in thermodynamics of computation where one wants to analyze the energy dissipation of a computation from a particular input to a particular output.},

The distance approximation has recently been suggested by Vitanyi and his col- leagues. They use a clustering method to evalute the distance metric. However the clustering is too slow for large (>60) data sets. We suggest using the distance metric together with a k-nearest neighbor classifier. We measure the performance of the distance metric based on the test classification accuracy of the classifier. A classification accu- racy of 79\% is achieved for a training data set of 57 midi files from three different classical composers. We find out that the classification accuracy increases with training set size. The performance of the metric seems to also depend on different pre-processing methods, hence domain knowledge and input representation could make a difference on how the distance metric performs.},

@article{1412045,
abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method does not use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (ternary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics, we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

In principle there is no need to make the classical distinction between analytic and synthetic models of music. This paper presents several methods for sampling from an analytic statistical model, and proposes a new approach that maintains the intra opus pattern repetition within an extant piece. A major component of creativity is the adaptation of extant art works, and this is also an efficient way to sample pieces from complex statistical models.},

abstract = {In general music composed by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffers from a lack of global structure. Though networks can learn note-by-note transition probabilities and even reproduce phrases, attempts at learning an entire musical form and using that knowledge to guide composition have been unsuccessful. The reason for this failure seems to be that RNNs cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has succeeded in similar domains where other RNNs have failed, such as timing \& counting and CSL learning. In the current study we show that LSTM is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music. We compare this approach to previous attempts, with particular focus on issues of data representation. We present experimental results showing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and we believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure it does not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.},

Somewhat to our surprise given its non-specific universal nature, the Kolmogorov complexity similarity based technique outperformed the others. The task used for our experiments involved classi- fication of MIDI files into one of 4 groups. Two of the categories were western classical music composed by Beethoven (302 files) and Haydn (261 files). The remaining categories were Chinese music (80 files) and Jazz (128 files). Melody contours (i.e. pitch sequences without timing details) were extracted from the MIDI file tracks. Both relative and absolute and pitch contours were used. The best performance of 92.35\% was achieved by a 1-nearest neighbour classifier with normalized information distance based on Kolmogorov complexity estimates over pitch interval contours. A notable feature of our work is the use of the number of blocks in a pure Lempel-Zip parse of a string to estimate its Kolmogorov complexity},

Our framework employs artificial music critics,which may be trained on large music corpora, and then pass aesthetic judgment on music artifacts. Music artifacts are generated by an evolutionary music composer, which utilizes music critics as fitness functions. To evaluate this approach we conducted three experiments. First, using music features based on Zipf’s law, we trained artificial neural networks to predict the popularity of 992 musical pieces with 87.85\% accuracy. Then, assuming that popularity correlates with aesthetics, we incorporated such neural networks into a genetic-programming system, called NEvMuse. NEvMuse autonomously “composed” novel variations of J.S. Bach’s Invention \#13 in A minor (BWV 784), variations which many listeners found to be aesthetically pleasing. Finally, we compared aesthetic judgments from an artificial music critic with emotional responses from 23 human subjects. Significant correlations were found. We provide evaluation results and samples of generated music. These results have implications for music information retrieval and computer- aided music composition.},

abstract = {In domains such as music and visual art, where the quality of an in- dividual often depends on subjective or hard to express concepts, the automat- ing fitness assignment becomes a difficult problem. This paper discusses the application of Zipf’s Law in evaluation of music pleasantness. Preliminary re- sults indicate that a set of Zipf-based metrics can be effectively used to clas- sify music according to pleasantness as reported by human subjects. These studies suggest that metrics based on Zipf’s law may capture essential aspects of proportion in music as it relates to music aesthetics. We discuss the signifi- cance of these results for the automation of fitness assignment in evolutionary music systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, a genetic algorithm for making music compositions is presented. Position based representation of rhythm and relative representation of pitches, based on measuring relation from starting pitch, allow for a flexible and robust way for encoding music compositions. This approach includes a pre-defined rhythm applied to initial population, giving good starting solutions. Modified genetic operators enable significantly changing scheduling of pitches and breaks, which can restore good genetic material and prevent from premature convergence in bad suboptimal solutions. Beside main principles of the algorithm and methodology of development, in this paper the analysis of solutions in general is also presented, as well as the analysis of the obtained solutions in relation to the key parameters. Some solutions are presented in the musical score.},

This extensible software includes an easy to use and flexible GUI. An extensive library of high-level musical features is compiled, including many original features. A novel hybrid classification system is used that makes use of hierarchical, flat and round robin classification. Both k-nearest neighbour and neural network-based classifiers are used, and feature selection and weighting are performed using genetic algorithms. A thorough review of previous research in automatic genre classification is presented, along with an overview of automatic feature selection and classification techniques. Also included is a discussion of the theoretical issues relating to musical genre, including but not limited to what mechanisms humans use to classify music by genre and how realistic genre taxonomies can be constructed.},

In this paper we describe new work on the use of connectionist techniques to automatically induce musical structure from a corpus. We show how the resulting neural networks can be used as critics that drive our genetic programming system. We argue that this framework can potentially support the induction and recapitulation of deep structural features of music. We present some initial results produced using neural and hybrid symbolic /neural critics, and we discuss directions for future work. 1 Introduction In previous work we developed a framework for the automatic generation of art-making programs on the basis of user-provided critical criteria},

abstract = {The interactive evolutionary computation (IEC), i.e., an evolutionary computation whose fitness function is provided by users, has been applied to aesthetic areas, such as art, design and music. We cannot always define fitness functions explicitly in these areas. With IEC, however, the user's implicit preference can be embedded into the optimization system. This paper describes a new approach to the music composition, more precisely the composition of rhythms, by means of IEC. The main feature of our method is to combine genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP). In our system, GA individuals represent short pieces of rhythmic patterns, while GP individuals express how these patterns are arranged in terms of their functions. Both populations are evolved interactively through the user's evaluation. The integration of interactive GA and GP makes it possible to search for musical structures effectively in the vast search space. In this paper, we describe how our proposed method generates attractive musical rhythms successfully.},
